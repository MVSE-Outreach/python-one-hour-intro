# Exercise sheet 2
1. Improve your “adding machine” into a calculator. It needs to ask the user for
   2 numbers, and then for an operator (either +, -, * or /). It then needs to
   apply the operator to the numbers and print the answer C so if the user
   enters 2, 3 and `*`, the answer 6 would be printed `(2 * 3)`.

2. You will notice that your calculator doesn't properly work for division (try
   entering 3/2!). Think about why this happens, and try to fix it. (Hint: ask
   your calculator to add together 1.5 and 1.6).

3. Write a program to print every number between 0 and 100 inclusive (note that
   inclusive means every number including the ones listed C so for this
   example, you need to print 0, 1, 2 all the way through to 98, 99, 100).

4. Write a program that prints every number between 20 and 25 inclusive AND 70
   and 80 inclusive, but using only one loop. Don't print out any other numbers.

5. Write a program to print all numbers between 0 and 80 inclusive that are
   divisible by 4.

6. Change your last program so that it doesn't print any numbers that are
   between 10 and 25 inclusive, but prints every other number that part 5 does.
