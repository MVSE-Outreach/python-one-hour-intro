# Introduction to python (in one hour!)

Authors: Thomas Mortensson, Ben Collins This project is designed to allow people
to pick up the included resources and teach a basic 1 hour lesson on some of the
core concepts of programming within Python.

This is very much a beginner session however it is designed to be accessible. We
are targeting this at teachers who want to learn Python in order to teach it
under the new UK curriculum or at students who want a quick HOW-TO on the basics
of programming or python.

This session is regularly held in Bristol at the DigiMakers events held at
@Bristol by the Bristol University Computer Science department. Search
EventBrite and the Bristol University websites for DigiMakers for details of our
next session.

Tutorials initially written by Thomas Mortensson and Ben Collins with support
from Graham Laming. Thanks go to Robert Briggs for initial LaTeX support.

Session has been tested 7 times to date as of 23/11/2013.

## Pre-requirements

A Raspberry Pi flashed with the default Raspbian image.

OR

Any machine capable of running Python (This guide is targeted at Python 2.7.x -
much is still applicable to Python 3.x) e.g. 
* Mac (Python preinstalled)
* Windows (Download python from http://www.python.org/download/)
* Linux (Search for "installing Python distro" where distro is your Linux distro
  - many will ship with Python by default), be sure to use Python 2 with these
    examples

## Usage

This session is centred around a handout document called `teaching_guide.pdf`.
This guide is written in LaTeX and can be edited via a file called
`teaching_guide.tex`.

The session is supplied with a basic exercise sheet titled
`exercise_sheets.pdf`. We recommend you come up with your own Exercise sheets as
this sheet is very basic and limited in it's scope, although it can be used
successfully for a first session.

Working Python Source code for the workshop is included in a folder called
`code_samples`. You may want to download and test this code before running a
session. This code also includes answers to an additional Exercise 3 which is
not included in the Exercise Document.

The Exercise document is split in 2 halves. One has questions and the second has
answers, this has been done to make it easier for teachers to produce handouts.
The main teaching guide has been limited in this iteration to 4 pages to allow
for easier duplex printing. The colours chosen should work well printed in
colour or in black and white. Similarly the Exercise sheet is a 1 page
handout for students and a duplexable 2 page printout for teachers to
minimise printing costs.
